# Simple-Shell

This is an implementation of a simple command-line shell. The shell supports bash commands as well as some built-in commands such as `fg` and `jobs`. The shell also features simple command piping and output redirection.

## Installation
```linux
git clone https://github.com/takavor/Simple-Shell.git
